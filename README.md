# Installation and setup of Remote Control Keybinds and Pseudo Channel
The setup.sh script sets keybinds to interact with Pseudo Channel ( https://github.com/mutto233/pseudo-channel ) and RasPlex.

To setup keybinds, clone repository to your home directory, do `sudo chmod +x setup.sh` then `./setup.sh` to set up and bind keys. Do NOT run as root.
